# gentle-return-2

Second version of my music website, coding from scratch with minimal CSS. 

# To do

* Set a minimum height for YouTube videos as you stretch responsively across screen widths. Currently the videos stretch appropriately, but then continue to stretch in width and not in height as you go larger. Basically, keep the aspect ratio the same as you stretch smaller or larger

* Create a responsive grid for the images

* Perhaps start thinking about colors and fancier layout styles

* Perhaps start thinking about some cool animations in the background

* Maybe start thinking about building a cool interactive art experience
